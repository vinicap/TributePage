                    <ul id="quotes-list">
                        <li>“All men desire peace, but very few desire those things that make for peace.”</li>
                        <li>“Fight like a man. Habit is overcome by habit.”</li>
                        <li>“All that is in the world is vanity except to love God and serve him only.”</li>
                        <li>“It is not really a small thing when in small things we resist self.”</li>
                        <li>“Let temporal things be in the use, eternal things in the desire.”</li>
                        <li>“It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and to lift up ourselves on high...It is vanity, to love that which quickly passeth away and not to hasten<br> where eternal joy abideth.”</li>
                        <li>"Whoever wishes to understand fully the words of Christ must try to pattern his whole life on that of Christ."</li>
                        <li>"Every man naturally desires knowledge; but what good is knowledge without fear of God? Indeed a humble rustic who serves God is better<br> than a proud intellectual who neglects his soul to study the course of the stars."</li>
                        <li>"If I knew all things in the world and had not charity, what would it profit me before God Who will judge me by my deeds?"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p id="section-footer">"Remarkable for its simple language and style, it emphasizes the spiritual rather than the materialistic life, affirms the rewards of being Christ-centred, and supports Communion as a means to strengthen faith."</p>
